# Godot 4.5 Mono web export example.

[Demo on Itch.io](https://kstgrd.itch.io/godot45net?secret=lc3VjeGNpn4PXlzJZRattN79s)

You could build it with Docker - run in the project root:
```bash
docker container run --rm -v ".:/src" kstgrd/godot-mono-web:4.5.dev
```

The build forlder contains `index.zip` ready to upload on Itch (don't forget to enable **SharedArrayBuffer support** on itch project dashboard).
